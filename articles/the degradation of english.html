                <p>This is going to be a rant about my generation's use of English. Yes I know, another "my generation sucks and I dont belong in it" tirade. 
                    But if you have heard the slang that is used by kids today, you'll understand. The first time you hear it your thoughts are "what the hell does that mean?". 
                    After hearing their botched version of English multiple times, feelings of contempt may begin to surface whenever a zoomer appears near you. Specifically the ones with
                     mushroom haircuts because you already know if they are willing to get a trendy haircut, 
                    they are also following their generation's trend of speaking like a middle school dropout.
                </p>
                <p>People born before 2000 are largely safe from getting their ear drums assaulted with verbal garbage, as gen Z'ers really only use their lingo amongst themselves. 
                    To teachers, employers, and their parents, they mostly speak like functioning humans. Once you enter the online space however, 
                    it's only a matter of time before you see pieces of text so separated from conventional English that you can't even understand the message.
                </p>
                <p>I've put together some terms that zoomers use in person and online so that you can understand what they're saying. Frankly, you're better off not knowing and simply
                     ignoring everything that comes out of their mouth once you hear a slang term. They don't have anything of value to say, trust me.
                </p>

                <div id="terms">
                <p>
                    <ul style="list-style: none;">
                        <li>cap = false,fake</li>
                        <li>fr = for real</li>
                        <li>bussin = doing well, very good</li>
                        <li>sus = suspect, suspicous</li>
                        <li>ong = on god, short for "I swear to god"</li>
                        <li>dub, W = win</li>
                        <li>ngl = not going to lie</li>
                        <li>bruh = bro</li>
                        <li>deadass = I'm serious</li>
                        <li>mid = average, mediocre</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                </div>
                <p>There are many more terms but it would be too cringe-inducing for me to write them all; you can look them up yourself. 
                    Of course the rate of usage varies between zoomers, and not all gen Z'ers use this kind of language. But a significant 
                    portion do talk like utter idiots, large enough to annoy me and many, many other people. It's not just slang and abbreviations, 
                    basic grammar rules are ignored as well. Errors such as "don't got" instead of "don't have" are all too common.
                </p>
                <p>Language is not static and is constantly evolving. Useful words or phrases arise and permeate the language. 
                    But this is not evolution, rather devolution. We are heading towards grunting like cave men again. 
                    Hopefully with age zoomers will stop using this kind of language. Hopefully.</p>
